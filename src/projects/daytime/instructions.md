There are two servers on this project and you should use server.js to test it since the python server.py is incomplete

To run the server you should run node server.js when you are inside the directory src/projects/daytime/server

then get in nside the directory src/projects/daytime/client 
and run the command 

"python3 client.py tcp" for tcp


 "python3 client.py udp" for udp

message "tcp connection from" would appear when succefully run tcp
message "udp dgram from 127.0.0.1:" would appear when succefully run udp
